# Coding-Quiz

## Description
I created this to further my knowledge with javascript, using more advanced functions and methodologies. My main experience this project was with DOM, element creation and traversal. SetTimeout and SetInterval functions.
As well as local storage stringify and parsing. I built upon my previous css and js knowledge gaining new tools in my skillset such as css opacity and transition as well as JS array sorting 

My main challenge came in the form of getting the quiz to iterate through questions. It took a lot of backtracking and youtube videos for me to finally understand what needed to be done. I did struggle with my local storage array parsing at first but was able to simply add "||[]" to the end of my code which created the array I needed. After that it was smooth sailing
